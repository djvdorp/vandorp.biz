Found some great instructions for putting a lightweight desktop
environment on your (Lowend) VPS or server.  
Uses no more then like 40mb RAM tops, but can be tweaked to only
10-20mb I think.

```bash
# Make sure Debian is the latest and greatest

apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get dist-upgrade

# Install X, LXDE, VPN programs

apt-get install xorg lxde-core tightvncserver

# Start VNC to create config file

tightvncserver :1

# Then stop VNC

tightvncserver -kill :1

# Edit config file to start session with LXDE:

nano ~/.vnc/xstartup

# Add this at the bottom of the file:
lxterminal &
/usr/bin/lxsession -s LXDE &

# Restart VNC

tightvncserver :1
```

You then connect using the VNC viewer of your choice on your local
computer. I use the "VNC Free Edition Viewer for Windows Stand-Alone
Viewer" at: http://www.realvnc.com Configure the viewer to access your
VPS at: _xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5901_.
