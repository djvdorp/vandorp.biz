After updating my Macbook Pro to OS X Lion this holiday, I couldn't
connect to the Eduroam wireless network anymore.

When I found out how to make it work, it was pretty easy! Just follow
these instructions:

 

1.  Save [this]({filename}/files/wpa2.hro.mobileconfig) file to your computer
2.  Open the file by double-clicking it, and it will ask for your HRO
    username (0000000@student.hro.nl) and password (xxxxx).
3.  Enter your system password when asked.
4.  Connect to the Eduroam Wifi network.
5.  You're done!

PS: This is exactly the same way to connect to Eduroam on the iPhone
